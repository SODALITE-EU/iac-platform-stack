# SODALITE stack blueprint deployed on openstack
Implementation of the blueprint and integration tests for the SODALITE platform stack

This repository contains the TOSCA/Ansible SODALITE stack deployment blueprints which can be deployed by SODALITE orchestrator [xOpera](https://github.com/xlab-si/xopera-opera).

This repository contains two deployment blueprints for the SODALITE platform supporting [openstack](https://www.openstack.org/) private cloud deployment.

NOTE: SODALITE currently uses the version [xOpera version 0.6.6](https://pypi.org/project/opera/0.6.6/) since xOpera is being developed to support [OASIS TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML version 1.3](https://www.oasis-open.org/news/announcements/tosca-simple-profile-in-yaml-v1-3-oasis-standard-published).
